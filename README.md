## UDSM-LLPS-Syn
In this study, we applied the deep sequence model â€“ [UDSMProt](https://github.com/nstrodt/UDSMProt) to two new protein classification tasks.
1.  predict proteins with liquid-liquid phase separation propensity
2. predict synaptic proteins<br />
Our results have shown that, without prior domain knowledge and only based on protein sequences, the fine-tuned language models achieved high classification accuracies and outperformed baseline models using compositional k-mer features in both tasks. For details of this work, please refer to our paper [**"Deep sequence representation learning for predicting human proteins with liquid-liquid phase separation propensity and synaptic functions"**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3535508.3545550) (Wei and Wang, 2022)
